 * Created by Suryasnata on 5/24/2017.
 * The following is a description of the instance of this famous puzzle involving n=2 eggs and a building with k=36 floors.
 * Suppose that we wish to know which stories in a 36-story building are safe to drop eggs from, and which will cause the eggs to break on landing. We make a few assumptions:
 * …..An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
 * …..A broken egg must be discarded.
 * …..The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
 * …..If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor.
 * …..If an egg survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall.
 * …..It is not ruled out that the first-floor windows break eggs, nor is it ruled out that the 36th-floor do not cause an egg to break.
